## File parser & Visualize logs
### File parser
This script parses the log files generated by the OBC board, and creates a more compact view of the logs.
it is also used by the Visualize logs script to plot the available data.

#### Usage:
```bash
  python ./fileParser.py <args>
```
- Replace args with a filename contained in the "logFiles" directory or with the keyword "all" to produce a parsed file for every file present in the "logFiles" directory.
- The output is saved in the "parsedLogs" folder, and the name is the same as the input file with the "out_" prefix.

### Visualize logs
This script extracts content from a parsed file and creates a plot with the available data.

#### Usage:
```bash
  python ./visualize_logs.py <args>
```
- Replace args with a filename contained in the "parsedLogs" directory or with the keyword "all" to create a plot for every file present in the "parsedLogs" directory (close the current one and press enter to move to the next plot).
